## What is ont-run?

Your ontology is your business in code—what exists, what can be done, who can do it.

**ont-run** is a framework where:

1. You define your **business structure** as an ontology — entities, functions, access groups
2. AI agents implement the logic and call your functions via MCP
3. Humans approve any changes to the ontology (the shape of your business)

The ontology is your operational DNA. AI writes code, but only humans change what the business *is*.

## Key Features

<CardGrid stagger>
  <Card title="Ontology-First" icon="document">
    Define your business structure—entities, functions, access groups—in a single declarative config.
  </Card>
  <Card title="Human-in-the-Loop" icon="approve-check">
    Ontology changes require human approval. AI builds the logic, but only humans change what the business *is*.
  </Card>
  <Card title="MCP Integration" icon="puzzle">
    Functions are automatically exposed as MCP tools. AI agents see only what their *user* is allowed to call.
  </Card>
  <Card title="TypeScript & Go" icon="seti:typescript">
    Write your backend in TypeScript or Go. Both support Zod-like schemas and automatic SDK generation.
  </Card>

## Quick Example

**TypeScript:**

```typescript
import { defineOntology, z } from 'ont-run';
import getUser from './resolvers/getUser.js';

export default defineOntology({
  name: 'my-api',
  accessGroups: {
    public: { description: 'Unauthenticated users' },
    admin: { description: 'Administrators' },
  },
  entities: {
    User: { description: 'A user account' },
  },
  functions: {
    getUser: {
      description: 'Get user by ID',
      access: ['admin'],
      entities: ['User'],
      inputs: z.object({ id: z.string().uuid() }),
      resolver: getUser,
    },
  },
});
```

**Go:**

```go
import ont "github.com/vanna-ai/ont-run/pkg/ontology"

func DefineOntology() *ont.Config {
    return &ont.Config{
        Name: "my-api",
        AccessGroups: map[string]ont.AccessGroup{
            "public": {Description: "Unauthenticated users"},
            "admin":  {Description: "Administrators"},
        },
        Entities: map[string]ont.Entity{
            "User": {Description: "A user account"},
        },
        Functions: map[string]ont.Function{
            "getUser": {
                Description: "Get user by ID",
                Access:      []string{"admin"},
                Entities:    []string{"User"},
                Inputs:      ont.Object(map[string]ont.Schema{
                    "id": ont.String().UUID(),
                }),
                Resolver: resolvers.GetUser,
            },
        },
    }
}
```
